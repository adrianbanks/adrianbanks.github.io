I have recently re-installed Firefox, and was getting more and more annoyed by what seemed to be a blinking cursor appearing in web pages. After a bit of searching, I found out what it was thanks to [Rishi](http://beyondteck.blogspot.com) who has had the [same problem](http://beyondteck.blogspot.com/2006/05/firefox-blinking-cursor-problem.html).

It is a feature called "Caret Browsing" which places a cursor in web pages so that text can be selected using only the keyboard. To turn the feature off, just press the F7 key or change the `accessibility.browsewithcaret` option from the `about:config` page.
