Microsoft recently released [Guidance Explorer](http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/GuidanceExplorer), a tool that contains a browsable collection of best-practice patterns for developing .Net and ASP.Net applications.

Both the tool and its guidance library have regular updates, containing best-practices for performance and security related issues.

The tool also has the ability to add custom sets of guidance to allow corporate/team standards to be included.
