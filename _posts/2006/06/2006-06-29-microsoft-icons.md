Microsoft's [Brad Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2006/06/06/618797.aspx) and [Somasegar](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2005/01/23/359124.aspx) both posted about a set of standard Microsoft icons that ship with Visual Studio 2005. They can be found in a zip file in the Visual Studio 2005 installation directory (usually `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\VS2005ImageLibrary\VS2005ImageLibrary.zip`). There are over 600 icons in total with a mixture of Windows, Office and Visual Studio icons, and are licenced for reuse in your own applications.
