A neat little project on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com) called [Managed Stack Explorer](http://www.codeplex.com/MSE) enables you to monitor running .Net applications.

Using this tool, you can view all currently running managed applications, monitor all of their threads, and even collect stack traces at regular intervals. Very useful for getting information about applications whilst running outside of a debugger.
