Following on from my [last post on the MDSN Low Bandwidth View]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009/04/2009-04-08-msdn-low-bandwidth-view %}), [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) recently [tweeted about the beta version of MDSN Lightweight View](http://twitter.com/shanselman/status/2428774227).

In a similar way to adding `(loband)` before the `.aspx` part of the url, putting `(lightweight)` before the `.aspx` part of the url will use the new lightweight view of MSDN, meaning a much neater and streamlined version.

In addition, Scott has previously posted about the other modes of MSDN:

| Mode | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - | The normal MSDN view	| [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.aspx) |
| (loband) | A minimal view, focussed on speed | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(loband).aspx) |
| (lightweight) | A faster lightweight view, including quick links to switch between languages and .Net framework versions | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(lightweight).aspx) |
| (pda) | Aimed at PDAs and phones. Turns off the tree and allows a 100% width | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(pda).aspx) |
| (robot) | Optimised for search engines | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(robot).aspx) |
| (printer) | A printable version | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(printer).aspx) |
| (ide) | Used when viewing inside the IDE. Adds send and give feedback links | [Example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object(ide).aspx) |

*Note that the dev10ide view Scott mentions seems to have been removed, and that the lightweight view is currently in beta, so may be liable to change.*
