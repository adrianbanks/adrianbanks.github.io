There's a nice little section on Microsoft's [MSDN site](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/) entitled [The C# Programming Language for Java Developers](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228602(VS.80).aspx) that explains the basics of the C# language features.

Although not incredibly detailed, it's quite a useful reference for simple language information, especially about the system types (such as the range of a `double` or what types can be implicitly cast to a `short`).
