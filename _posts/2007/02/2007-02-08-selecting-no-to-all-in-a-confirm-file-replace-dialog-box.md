When copying files in Windows, you are sometimes prompted about replacing an existing file.

The available options are Yes, Yes To All, No and Cancel. But what if you are copying a large number of files and want to choose the non-existent 'No To All' option? Well simply hold in the shift key while clicking the No option and it will apply that choice to all subsequent dialogs within the current operation.
