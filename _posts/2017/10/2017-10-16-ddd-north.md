I recently attended [DDD North 2017](http://www.dddnorth.co.uk) in Bradford. I've been wanting to take up sketchnoting for a while now, but have never gotten round to doing it, so when [Ian Johnson](https://twitter.com/IJohnson_TNF) (go check out [his sketchnotes](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aijohnson_tnf%20%23sketchnote&src=typd) - they are great) prompted me to take my sketchbook and pens with me, I reluctantly obliged. I'm so glad I did though as I really enjoyed doing them, and I feel it had the effect of me being able to recall much more of the content of each talk. I [tweeted the sketchnotes](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aadrianbanks%20%23dddnorth%20by&src=typd) after each session and got a great response from both the speakers and attendees.

Here are the sketchnotes I did during the day.
