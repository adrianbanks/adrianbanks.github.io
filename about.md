I have been programming for many years. I first started programming on a ZX Spectrum in the early 1980s and later progressed to the Atari ST.

My first published work (click [here](/assets/media/images/about/bic.gif) to view the article) was in 1995 on an ST Format cover disk with a small utility called BIC (which you can download [here](http://www.adrianbanks.co.uk/downloads/download.php?id=80f32862e86af04186a1f24ad2f1e457)).

I am now a software engineer by trade, working for a software house which produces database tools.
