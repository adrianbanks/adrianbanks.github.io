### Early years

I have been programming for many years. I first started programming on a ZX Spectrum that I had for my fourth birthday. This was mainly typing games into it from computer magazines and experimenting by chainging them to see what effect the changes had.

Later, I progressed to the Atari ST and continued programming, making simple applications in my spare time. At the age of twelve, one of my programs for designing gears was bought by a local engineering company and was used as part of their design process.

My first published work ([see the article](/assets/media/images/about/bic.gif)) was on an ST Format cover disk with a small utility called [BIC](http://www.adrianbanks.co.uk/downloads/download.php?id=80f32862e86af04186a1f24ad2f1e457).

### Later years

I went to university to do an engineering degree, but soon realised that software was where my interest really lay. I altered my degree and graduated with a Masters in Electronic and Software Engineering.

I am now a software engineer by trade, working for a software house which produces database tools for developers.

### Stackoverflow

I have been an active contributor to [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for many years. I find it an invaluable resource for modern software development, but also a useful tool for learning new things.
