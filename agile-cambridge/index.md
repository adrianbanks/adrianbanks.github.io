title: Tracking the unmeasurable with OKRs
---

Last year, my team was tasked with handing over a product to another team. We needed to ensure a successful handover, so we set out to create some OKRs to make sure that we knew what we were trying to achieve in the preparations. The objective part was easy, but we struggled with the key results: how could we measure the success ahead of time without actually doing the handover first?

I'll show how we applied a technique from the world of mathematical uncertainty to measure how successful the handover would be before it actually happened. I'll describe how we framed the initial problem to enable us to measure it, the steps involved in taking the measurements, how those measurements shaped our handover preparations, and compare our predictions to the actual outcome of the handover.

You'll come away from this talk with a structure for how to apply this technique to other similar situations that you may have.
